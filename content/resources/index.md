## Mental heath and wellness support 

If your mental health concerns and/or stressful events negatively affect your daily emotional state, academic performance, or ability to participate in your daily activities, many resources are available to you, including ones listed below. Duke encourages all students to access these resources, particularly as we navigate the transition and emotions associated with this time. Duke Student Government has worked with DukeReach and student advocates to create the Fall 2020 ["Two-Click Support"](https://bit.ly/TwoClickSupport) Form, and [Duke Reach](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/dukereach1) has expanded its drop in hours as well.


- **DukeReach**: Provides comprehensive outreach services to identify and support students in managing all aspects of well being. If you have concerns about a student's behavior or health visit the website for resources and assistance.

## Wellness day 2021 

In lieu of a traditional class meeting on April 12, please use our regular class time to engage in reflection and wellness endeavors. A list of wellness strategies and programs is available at [studentaffairs.duke.edu/duwell/wellness-day-2021](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/duwell/wellness-day-2021) and will be updated throughout the spring.

Although the goal of Wellness Day 2021 is to provide time and space to engage in activities that enhance your well-being, please remember that wellness isnâ€™t achieved in one day. Balancing your personal, professional, and academic commitments is a skill that should be practiced regularly and over time.
