## Asking for help

If you're asking for R help, reporting a bug, or requesting a new feature, you're more likely to succeed if you include a good reproducible example, which is precisely what the [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package is built for. You can learn more about reprex, along with other tips on how to help others help you in the [tidyverse.org help section](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/).


## Where to ask

Now that you've made a reprex, you need to share it in an appropriate forum. Here are some options:

* [__community.rstudio.com__](https://community.rstudio.com/c/ml/15): This is a warm
  and welcoming place to ask any questions you might have about
  tidymodels or more generally about modeling, machine learning, and deep learning. (You can also ask questions about the tidyverse and RStudio there, too!)
  
* [__Stack Overflow__](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tidymodels). You're probably already familiar
  with Stack Overflow from googling; it's a frequent source of answers to
  coding related questions. Asking a question on Stack Overflow can be 
  intimidating, but if you've taken the time to create a reprex, you're much
  more likely to get a useful answer. Make sure to [tag your question](https://stackoverflow.com/help/tagging) with `r`
  and `tidymodels` so that the right people are more likely to see it.
  
* [__Twitter__][twitter-rstats]. It's hard to share your reprex only on twitter, because 280 characters are rarely enough and screenshots don't help others play with your code. However, twitter is a great place to share a link to your reprex that's hosted elsewhere! The [#rstats twitter][twitter-rstats] community is extremely friendly and active, and is a great crowd to be a part of. Make sure you tag your tweet with `#rstats` and `#tidymodels`.

* If you think you've found a __bug__, please follow the instructions for filing an issue on 
  [contributing to tidymodels](/contribute/).
