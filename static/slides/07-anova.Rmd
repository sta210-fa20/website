### Capital Bike Share

The [Capital Bike Share](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/) is a bike share program in Washington D.C. where customers can rent a bike for a small fee, ride it around the city, and return it to a station located near their destination 


<br><br>

Bike riding is often correlated with environmental conditions, so we are going to analyze the relationship between season (.vocab[`season`]) and the number of daily bike rentals (.vocab[`count`])

---

### Capital Bike Share

Our dataset contains the number of bikes rented and other information for **100 randomly selected days** in 2011 and 2012

```{r}
bikeshare <- read_csv("data/bikeshare-sample.csv")
glimpse(bikeshare)
```

---

### Bike rentals

```{r echo = F, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(data = bikeshare, aes(x = count)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  labs(title = "Number of Daily Bike Rentals", 
       x = "Daily Bike Rentals")
```

```{r echo = F}
bikeshare %>%
  summarise(n = n(), mean = mean(count), sd = sd(count))
```


---

class: middle

.vocab[Question]: Is there a statistically significant difference in the mean number of bikes rented in each season? 

---

## Bike rentals by season 

```{r echo = F}
ggplot(data = bikeshare, aes(x = season, y = count)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
    labs(x = "Season", 
       y = "Daily Bike Rentals")
```

---

## Bike rentals by season 

```{r echo = F}
ggplot(data = bikeshare, aes(x = count, fill = season)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) + 
  labs(x = "Daily Bike Rentals")
```

---

### Bike rentals by season

```{r echo = F}
bikeshare %>%
  group_by(season) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), mean = mean(count), sd = sd(count))
```

---

class: middle

So far, we have used a .vocab[quantitative] predictor variable to understand the variation in a quantitative response variable.
<br>


Now, we will use a .vocab[categorical (qualitative)] predictor variable to understand the variation in a quantitative response variable.

---

### Let's fit a model

```{r}
bike_model <- lm(count ~ season, data = bikeshare)
tidy(bike_model, conf.int = TRUE) %>%
  kable(format = "markdown", digits = 3)
```
---

### In-class exercise 

```{r echo = F}
bike_model <- lm(count ~ season, data = bikeshare)
tidy(bike_model, conf.int = TRUE) %>%
  kable(format = "markdown", digits = 3)
```

.question[

- Go to http://bit.ly/sta210-sp20-bike and use the model to answer the questions

- Use **NetId@duke.edu** for your email address.

- You are welcome (and encouraged!) to discuss these questions with 1 - 2 people around you, but **each person** must submit a response.
]

```{r echo = F}
library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 4, seconds = 0, update_every = 1, warn_when = 30)
```

---

### How much variation is explained by our model?

**Question:** What proportion of the variation in number of daily bike rentals is explained by season? 

--

```{r}
rsquare(bike_model, bikeshare)
```

About 31.12% of the variation in the number of daily bike rentals is explained by the season.

### Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

.alert[
$$\small{\hat{\text{count}} = 5180.2 - 256.591 ~\text{Spring} + 558.911 ~\text{Summer} - 2400.760 ~\text{Winter}}$$
]

```

### Notation

- $K$ is number of mutually exclusive groups. We index the groups as $i = 1,\dots, K$.
<br>

--

- $n_i$ is number of observations in group $i$
<br>

--

- $n = n_1 + n_2 + \dots + n_K$ is the total number of observations in the data
<br>

--
  
- $y_{ij}$ is the $j^{th}$ observation in group $i$, for all $i,j$
<br>

--

- $\mu_i$ is the population mean for group $i$, for $i = 1,\dots, K$

---

### Motivating ANOVA

.alert[
$$y_{ij} = \mu_i + \epsilon_{ij}$$
]

.vocab[Assumption]: $\epsilon_{ij}$ follows a Normal distribution with mean 0 and constant variance $\sigma^2$
$$\epsilon_{ij} \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$$

- This is the same as $$y_{ij} \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$$

---

### Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

**Main Idea: ** Decompose the <font color="green">total variation</font> in the data into the variation <font color="blue">between groups (model)</font> and the variation <font color="red">within each group (residuals)</font>

$$\color{green}{\sum_{i=1}^{K}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}- \bar{y})^2}=\color{blue}{\sum_{i=1}^{K}n_i(\bar{y}_i-\bar{y})^2} + \color{red}{\sum_{i=1}^{K}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}-\bar{y}_i)^2}$$
<br>

--

.alert[
$$R^2 = \frac{\color{blue}{\text{Variation between groups (model)}}}{\color{green}{\text{Total variation}}} = \frac{\color{blue}{\sum_{i=1}^{K}n_i(\bar{y}_i-\bar{y})^2}}{\color{green}{\sum_{i=1}^{K}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}- \bar{y})^2}}$$
]

---

### Total Variation

- Total variation = variation between and within groups 

$$SST =\sum_{i=1}^{K}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}-\bar{y})^2$$
--

- Degrees of freedom
$$DFT = n-1$$
--

- Estimate of the variance across all observations: 
$$\frac{SST}{DFT} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{K}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}-\bar{y})^2}{n-1} = s_y^2$$

---

### Between Variation (Model)

- Variation in the group means

$$SSB = \sum_{i=1}^{K}n_i(\bar{y}_i-\bar{y})^2$$
--

- **Degrees of freedom**
$$DFB = K-1$$
--

- **Mean Squares Between**
$$MSB = \frac{SSB}{DFB} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{K}n_i(\bar{y}_i-\bar{y})^2}{K-1}$$
--

- MSB is an estimate of the variance of the $\mu_i$'s 
  
  
---

### Within Variation (Residual)

- Variation within each group

$$SSW=\sum_{i=1}^{K}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}-\bar{y}_k)^2$$
--

- **Degrees of freedom**

$$DFW = n-K$$
--

- **Mean Squares Within**
$$MSW = \frac{SSW}{DFW} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{K}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}-\bar{y}_i)^2}{n-K}$$
--

- MSW is the estimate of $\sigma^2$, the variance within each group

---

### Using ANOVA to test difference in means

- <font class="vocab">Question of interest </font> Is the mean value of the response $y$ the same for all groups, or is there at least one group with a significantly different mean value?

- To answer this question, we will test the following hypotheses:

.alert[
$$
\begin{aligned}
&H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \dots =  \mu_K\\
&H_a: \text{At least one }\mu_i \text{ is not equal to the others}
\end{aligned}
$$
]

--

- <font class = "vocab">How to think about it:</font>  If the sample means are "far apart", " there is evidence against $H_0$

- We will calculate a test statistic to quantify "far apart" in the context of the data

---

### Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

- **Main Idea: ** Decompose the <font color="green">total variation</font> in the data into the variation <font color="blue">between groups</font> and the variation <font color="red">within each group</font>

$$\color{green}{\sum_{i=1}^{K}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}- \bar{y})^2}=\color{blue}{\sum_{i=1}^{K}n_i(\bar{y}_i-\bar{y})^2} + \color{red}{\sum_{i=1}^{K}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}-\bar{y}_i)^2}$$
<br>

--

- If the variation <font color="blue">between groups</font> is significantly greater than the variation <font color="red">within each group</font>, then there is evidence against the null hypothesis.

### ANOVA table for comparing means

.small[
|  | Sum of Squares | DF | Mean Square | F-Stat| p-value |
|------------------|----------------|--------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------|
| Between (Model) | $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{K}n_i(\bar{y}_i-\bar{y})^2$ | $K-1$ | $SSB/(K-1)$ | $MSB/MSW$ | $P(F > \text{F-Stat})$ |
| Within (Residual) | $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{K}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}-\bar{y}_i)^2$ | $n-K$ | $SSW/(n-K)$ |  |  |
| Total | $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{K}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}-\bar{y})^2$ | $n-1$ | $SST/(n-1)$ |  |  |
]

---

### Using ANOVA to test difference in means

.vocab[Hypotheses]: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
&H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \dots =  \mu_K\\
&H_a: \text{At least one }\mu_i \text{ is not equal to the others}
\end{aligned}
$$
<br><br>

.vocab[Test statistic]: $$\frac{MSB}{MSW} = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{K}n_i(\bar{y}_i-\bar{y})^2 / (K - 1)}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{K}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}-\bar{y}_i)^2 / (n-K)}$$

---

### Calculate p-value

Calculate the p-value using an F distribution with $K-1$ and $n-K$ degrees of freedom

```{r, echo=F, fig.height = 4.2}
x <- seq(from =0, to = 5, length = 100)

# Evaluate the densities
y_1 <- df(x, 1,2)
y_2 <- df(x,2,2)
y_3 <- df(x,10,2)
y_4 <- df(x,10,10)

# Plot the densities
plot(x, y_1, col = 1, type = "l", ylab="",lwd=3)
lines(x,y_2, col = 2,lwd=3)
lines(x, y_3, col = 3,lwd=3)
lines(x, y_4, col = 4,lwd=3)

# Add the legend
legend("topright", title = "F Distribution",
       c("df = (1,2)", "df = (2,2)", "df = (10,2)", "df = (10,10)"), 
       col = c(1, 2, 3, 4), lty = 1)
```

### Capital Bike Share: ANOVA

```{r echo = F}
anova(bike_model) %>%
  kable(format = "markdown", digits = 3)
```

.question[

- You are welcome (and encouraged!) to discuss these questions with 1 - 2 people around you, but **each person** must submit a response.

```{r echo = F}
library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 4, seconds = 0, update_every = 1, warn_when = 30)
```

### Assumptions for ANOVA

- <font class="vocab">Normality: </font> $y_{ij} \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$

- <font class="vocab">Constant variance: </font> The population distribution for each group has a common variance, $\sigma^2$

- <font class="vocab">Independence: </font> The observations are independent from one another
    - This applies to observation within and between groups

- We can typically check these assumptions in the exploratory data analysis

---

### Robustness to Assumptions

- <font class="vocab">Normality: </font> $y_{ij} \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$
  + ANOVA relatively robust to departures from Normality. 
  + Concern when there are strongly skewed distributions with different sample sizes (especially if sample sizes are small, < 10 in each group)
  

- <font class="vocab">Independence: </font> There is independence within and across groups
  + If this doesn't hold, should use methods that account for correlated errors

---

### Robustness to Assumptions

- <font class="vocab">Constant variance: </font> The population distribution for each group has a common variance, $\sigma^2$
  + Critical assumption, since the pooled (combined) variance is important for ANOVA
  + **General rule:** If the sample sizes within each group are approximately equal, the results of the F-test are valid if the largest variance is no more than 4 times the smallest variance (i.e. the largest standard deviation is no more than 2 times the smallest standard deviation)
  
---

### Capital Bike Share: Normality

```{r}
ggplot(data = bikeshare, aes(x = count)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_wrap(~season) + 
  labs(title = "Daily bike rentals by season")
```

---

### Capital Bike Share: Constant Variance

```{r}
bikeshare %>%
  group_by(season) %>%
  summarise(sd = sd(count))
```

---

### Capital Bike Share: Independence

- Recall that the data is 100 randomly selected days in 2011 and 2012. 
- Let's look at the counts in date order to see if a pattern still exists

```{r echo = F, fig.height = 2}
ggplot(data = bikeshare, aes(x = dteday, y = count)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Date", 
       y = "Number of daily bike rentals", 
       title = "Number of daily bike rentals over time")
```

--

Though the days were randomly selected, it still appears the independence assumption is violated. 
- Additional methods may be required to fully examine this data.

---

### Why not just use the model output?

```{r echo = F}
bike_model <- lm(count ~ season, data = bikeshare)
tidy(bike_model, conf.int = TRUE) %>%
  kable(format = "markdown", digits = 3)
```


- The model coefficients and associated hypothesis test / confidence interval are interpreted in relation to the baseline level
    - The coefficients, test statistics, confidence intervals, and p-values all change if the baseline category changes (more on this later!)

- An ANOVA test gives indication if **<u>any</u>** category has a significantly different mean regardless of the baseline
    - The sum of squares, mean squares, test statistic, and p-value stay the same even if the baseline changes

## Recap

--

- Conducted a hypothesis test for $\beta_1$

--

- Calculated a confidence interval for $\beta_1$
