## Topics

- Introduce multinomial logistic regression 

- Interpret model coefficients

- Inference for a coefficient $\beta_{jk}$

---

## Generalized Linear Models (GLM)

- In practice, there are many different types of response variables including:

  + **Binary**: Win or Lose
  + **Nominal**: Democrat, Republican or Third Party candidate
  + **Ordered**: Movie rating (1 - 5 stars)
  + and others...

- These are all examples of **generalized linear models**, a broader class of models that generalize the multiple linear regression model 

- See [*Generalized Linear Models: A Unifying Theory*](https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-bysh/ch-glms.html) for more details about GLMs


---

## Binary Response (Logistic)

- Given $P(y_i=1|x_i)= \hat{\pi}_i\hspace{5mm} \text{ and } \hspace{5mm}P(y_i=0|x_i) = 1-\hat{\pi}_i$

$$\log\Big(\frac{\hat{\pi}_i}{1-\hat{\pi}_i}\Big) = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_{i}$$
<br> 

- We can calculate $\hat{\pi}_i$ by solving the logit equation: 

$$\hat{\pi}_i = \frac{\exp\{\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_{i}\}}{1 + \exp\{\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_{i}\}}$$

---

## Binary Response (Logistic)

Suppose we consider $y=0$ the .vocab[baseline category] such that 

$$P(y_i=1|x_i) = \hat{\pi}_{i1} \hspace{2mm}  \text{ and } \hspace{2mm} P(y_i=0|x_i) = \hat{\pi}_{i0}$$

--

Then the logistic regression model is 

$$\log\bigg(\frac{\hat{\pi}_{i1}}{1- \hat{\pi}_{i1}}\bigg) = \log\bigg(\frac{\hat{\pi}_{i1}}{\hat{\pi}_{i0}}\bigg) = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_i$$

--

<font class="vocab">Slope, $\hat{\beta}_1$</font>: When $x$ increases by one unit, the odds of $y=1$ versus the baseline $y=0$ are expected to multiply by a factor of $\exp\{\hat{\beta}_1\}$

<font class="vocab">Intercept, $\hat{\beta}_0$</font>: When $x=0$, the predicted odds of $y=1$ versus the baseline $y=0$ are $\exp\{\hat{\beta}_0\}$

---

## Multinomial response variable

- Suppose the response variable $y$ is categorical and can take values $1, 2, \ldots, K$ such that $(K > 2)$

- <font class="vocab">Multinomial Distribution: </font>

$$P(y=1) = \pi_1, P(y=2) = \pi_2, \ldots, P(y=K) = \pi_K$$

such that $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{K} \pi_k = 1$

---

## Multinomial Logistic Regression

- If we have an explanatory variable $x$, then we want to fit a model such that $P(y = k) = \pi_k$ is a function of $x$

--

- Choose a baseline category. Let's choose $y=1$.  Then, 

.eq[
$$\log\bigg(\frac{\pi_{ik}}{\pi_{i1}}\bigg) = \beta_{0k} + \beta_{1k} x_i$$
]

--

- In the multinomial logistic model, we have a separate equation for each category of the response relative to the baseline category
    - If the response has $K$ possible categories, there will be $K-1$ equations as part of the multinomial logistic model

---

## Multinomial Logistic Regression 

- Suppose we have a response variable $y$ that can take three possible outcomes that are coded as "A", "B", "C"

- Let "A" be the baseline category. Then 

$$\log\bigg(\frac{\pi_{iB}}{\pi_{iA}}\bigg) = \beta_{0B} + \beta_{1B}x_i \\[10pt]
\log\bigg(\frac{\pi_{iC}}{\pi_{iA}}\bigg) = \beta_{0C} + \beta_{1C} x_i$$

## NHANES Data

- [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) is conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) 

- The goal is to *"assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States"*

- This survey includes an interview and a physical examination

---

## NHANES Data

- We will use the data from the <font class="vocab">`NHANES`</font> R package

- Contains 75 variables for the 2009 - 2010 and 2011 - 2012 sample years

- The data in this package is modified for educational purposes and should **not** be used for research

- Original data can be obtained from the [NCHS website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/index.htm) for research purposes

- Type <font class="vocab">`?NHANES`</font> in console to see list of variables and definitions

---

## Health Rating vs. Age & Physical Activity

- **Question**: Can we use a person's age and whether they do regular physical activity to predict their self-reported health rating?

- We will analyze the following variables: 

  + <font class="vocab">`HealthGen`: </font>Self-reported rating of participant's health in general.  Excellent, Vgood, Good, Fair, or Poor.
  
    + <font class="vocab">`Age`: </font>Age at time of screening (in years). Participants 80 or older were recorded as 80.
    
  + <font class="vocab">`PhysActive`: </font>Participant does moderate to vigorous-intensity sports, fitness or recreational activities

 
---

## The data

```{r}
library(NHANES)

nhanes_adult <- NHANES %>%
  filter(Age >= 18) %>%
  select(HealthGen, Age, PhysActive) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(obs_num = 1:n())
```

```{r}
glimpse(nhanes_adult)
```

---

## Exploratory data analysis

```{r echo = F, out.width = "80%"}

p1 <- ggplot(data = nhanes_adult, aes(x = Age)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Age")

p2 <- ggplot(data = nhanes_adult, aes(x = PhysActive)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Moderate or vigorous sport or exercise")

p3 <- ggplot(data = nhanes_adult, aes(x = HealthGen)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Self-reported rating of overall health")

p3 + (p1 / p2)
```

---

## Exploratory data analysis

```{r echo = F, out.width = "80%"}
p1 <- ggplot(data = nhanes_adult, aes(x = HealthGen, y = Age)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "steelblue") + 
  labs(title = "Age vs. Health Rating") +
  coord_flip()

p2 <- ggplot(data = nhanes_adult, aes(x = PhysActive, fill = HealthGen)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(y = "Proportion", 
       title = "Physical Activity vs. Health Rating") 

p1 + p2
```

---

## Model in R

- Use the <font class="vocab">`multinom()`</font> function in the `nnet` package 

```{r, echo = T, results = "hide"}
library(nnet)
health_m <- multinom(HealthGen ~ Age + PhysActive, 
                     data = nhanes_adult)
```

- Put `results = "hide"` in the code chunk header to suppress convergence output 

---

## Output results

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
tidy(health_m, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = FALSE) %>%
  kable(digits = 3, format = "markdown")
```

---

## Model output

.small[
```{r}
tidy(health_m, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = FALSE) %>%
  kable(digits = 3, format = "markdown")
```
]

---

## Fair vs. Excellent Health

The baseline category for the model is .vocab[`Excellent`]. 

--

The model equation for the log-odds a person rates themselves as having "Fair" health vs. "Excellent" is

$$\log\Big(\frac{\hat{\pi}_{Fair}}{\hat{\pi}_{Excellent}}\Big) = 0.915  + 0.003 ~ \text{age} - 1.645 ~ \text{PhysActive}$$

---

## Interpretations

.eq[
$$\log\Big(\frac{\hat{\pi}_{Fair}}{\hat{\pi}_{Excellent}}\Big) = 0.915  + 0.003 ~ \text{age} - 1.645 ~ \text{PhysActive}$$
]

For each additional year in age, the odds a person rates themselves as having fair health versus excellent health are expected to multiply by `r round(exp(0.003), 3)` (exp(0.003)), holding physical activity constant. 

--

The odds a person who does physical activity will rate themselves as having fair health versus excellent health are  expected to be `r round(exp(-1.645	),3)` (exp(-1.645	)) times the odds for a person who doesn't do physical activity, holding age constant.

---

## Interpretations

.eq[
$$\log\Big(\frac{\hat{\pi}_{Fair}}{\hat{\pi}_{Excellent}}\Big) = 0.915  + 0.003 ~ \text{age} - 1.645 ~ \text{PhysActive}$$
]

The odds a 0 year old person who doesn't do physical activity rates themselves as having fair health vs. excellent health are `r round(exp(0.915),3)` (exp(0.915)).

`r emo::ji("warning")` **Need to mean-center age for the intercept to have a meaningful interpretation!**

## Hypothesis test for $\beta_{jk}$

The test of significance for the coefficient $\beta_{jk}$ is 

.alert[

**Hypotheses**: $H_0: \beta_{jk} = 0 \hspace{2mm} \text{ vs } \hspace{2mm} H_a: \beta_{jk} \neq 0$

**Test Statistic**: $$z = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{jk} - 0}{SE(\hat{\beta_{jk}})}$$

**P-value**: $P(|Z| > |z|)$, 

where $Z \sim N(0, 1)$, the Standard Normal distribution
]

---

## Confidence interval for $\beta_{jk}$

- We can calculate the .vocab[C% confidence interval] for $\beta_{jk}$ using the following:

$$\hat{\beta}_{jk} \pm z^* SE(\hat{\beta}_{jk})$$
where $z^*$ is calculated from the $N(0,1)$ distribution

.alert[
We are $C\%$ confident that for every one unit change in $x_{j}$, the odds of $y = k$ versus the baseline will multiply by a factor of $\exp\{\hat{\beta}_{jk} - z^* SE(\hat{\beta}_{jk})\}$ to $\exp\{\hat{\beta}_{jk} + z^* SE(\hat{\beta}_{jk})\}$, holding all else constant.
  ]

---

## Interpreting confidence intervals for $\beta_{jk}$


```{r}
tidy(health_m, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = FALSE) %>%
  filter(y.level == "Fair") %>%
  kable(digits = 3, format = "markdown")
```
<br> 

--

We are 95% confident, that for each additional year in age, the odds a person rates themselves as having fair health versus excellent health will multiply by  `r round(exp(-0.003), 3)` (exp(-0.003)) to `r round(exp(0.009), 3)` (exp(0.009)) , holding physical activity constant. 

---

## Interpreting confidence intervals for $\beta_{jk}$


```{r}
tidy(health_m, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = FALSE) %>%
  filter(y.level == "Fair") %>%
  kable(digits = 3, format = "markdown")
```

<br> 

We are 95% confident that the odds a person who does physical activity will rate themselves as having fair health versus excellent health are `r round(exp(-1.856	),3)` (exp(-1.856	)) to `r round(exp(-1.435),3)` (exp(-1.435)) times the odds for a person who doesn't do physical activity, holding age constant.
