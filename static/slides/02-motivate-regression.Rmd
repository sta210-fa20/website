## Sales vs. Advertising 

- Suppose you are a data scientist on the marketing team and the company wants to improve the sales of their premiere product 

- You want to understand the relationship between .vocab[advertising budget] and .vocab[total sales]

- The goal is to advise the marketing team about how to set the advertising budget based on their target sales goals

---

## Advertising vs. Sales

```{r glimpse}
glimpse(advertising)
```

--

- .vocab[Observations]: 200 markets

--

- .vocab[Variables]:
    - `tv`: Spending on TV ads (in $thousands)
    - `radio`: Spending on radio ads (in $thousands)
    - `newspaper`: Spending on newspaper ads (in $thousands)
    - `sales`: total sales (in $millions)
   
---

## Terminology

- `sales` is the .vocab[response variable]
    - variable whose variation we want to understand / variable we wish to predict
    - also known as *outcome* or *dependent* variable

--

<br> 

- `tv`, `radio`, `newspaper` are the .vocab[predictor variables]
    - variables used to account for variation in the outcome
    - also known as *explanatory*, *independent*, or *input* variables

---

## Let's look at the data

```{r echo=F, fig.height = 2.5}
p1 <- advertising %>% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=tv,y=sales)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) + 
  labs(x = "TV Ads (in $1000s)", 
       y = "Sales (in $millions)") + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="blue",se=FALSE) 

p2 <- advertising %>% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=radio,y=sales)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) + 
  labs(x = "Radio Ads (in $1000s)", 
       y = "Sales (in $millions)") + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="red", se=FALSE) 

p3 <- advertising %>% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=newspaper,y=sales)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) + 
  labs(x = "Newspaper (in $1000s)", 
       y = "Sales (in $millions)") + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="purple", se=FALSE) 

p1 + p2 + p3
```

--

Each line represents model we could use to predict `sales` using `tv`, `radio`, or `newspaper`

---

## Plot Data

```{r show-plot-2,echo=F}
p1 <- advertising %>% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=tv,y=sales)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="blue",se=FALSE) 

p2 <- advertising %>% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=radio,y=sales)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="red", se=FALSE) 

p3 <- advertising %>% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=newspaper,y=sales)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="purple", se=FALSE) 

p1 + p2 + p3
```

$$\text{sales} = f(\text{tv}, \text{radio}, \text{newspaper}) + \epsilon$$

## Model 

.alert[
$$\text{sales} = f(\text{tv}, \text{radio}, \text{newspaper}) + \epsilon$$
]

- **Goal**: Estimate $f$

--

- How do we estimate $f$?

--

    - <font class="vocab">Non-parametric methods:</font> estimate $f$ by getting as close to the data points as possible without making explicit assumptions about the functional form of $f$
    
--

    - <font class="vocab">Parametric methods:</font> estimate $f$ by making an assumption about the functional form of $f$ then using the data to fit a model based on that form 
    
---

class: middle, center

.alert[
In this class, we will focus on <font class="vocab">parametric methods</font>
]

<small>
*Non-parametric methods covered in STA 325: Machine Learning & Data Mining*
</small>

---

## General form of model

.alert[
$$Y = f(\mathbf{X}) + \epsilon$$
]

- $Y$: quantitative response variable

- $\mathbf{X} = (X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p)$: predictor variables

- $f$: fixed but unknown function
    - systematic information $\mathbf{X}$ provides about $Y$

- $\epsilon$: random error term with mean 0 that is independent of $\mathbf{X}$ 
   
---

## How to estimate $f$?

In general, we will use the following steps to estimate $f$

1. Choose the functional form of $f$, i.e. <font class="vocab">choose the appropriate model given the data</font>
    - Ex: $f$ is a linear model
    $$f(\mathbf{X}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \dots + \beta_p X_p + \epsilon$$

--

2. Use the data to fit (or train) the model, i.e. <font class="vocab">estimate the model parameters</font>
    - Ex: Use a method to estimate the model parameters $\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p$

---

## Why estimate $f$?

Suppose we have the model

$$\text{sales} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{tv} + \beta_2 \times \text{radio} + \beta_3 \times \text{newspaper} + \epsilon$$

.question[
What are 1-2 questions you could answer using this model?
]

---

## Why estimate $f$?

There are two types of questions we may be interesting in answering with our model: 

- <font class="vocab">Prediction: </font> What is the expected $Y$  given particular values of  $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p$? 
--

    - Ex: What is the expected `sales` in a market if the company spends $100,000 TV ads, $30,000 on radio ads, and $10,000 on newspaper ads?

--

- <font class="vocab">Inference: </font> What is the relationship between $\mathbf{X}$ and $Y$. How does $Y$ change as a function of $\mathbf{X}$?
--

    - Ex: Which type of media advertising generates the largest boost in sales?


---

## Prediction 

$$\hat{\text{sales}} = \hat{f}(\text{tv},\text{radio}, \text{newspaper})$$

- **Question**: How accurate is $\hat{\text{sales}}$ as a prediction of $\text{sales}$?

- This depends on two quantities: reducible and irreducible error

--
    - <font class="vocab">Reducible error:</font> error that can potentially be reduced by using a model , $\hat{f}$, that is a more appropriate fit for the data

--
    - <font class="vocab">Irreducible error: </font> Error that cannot be reduced even if the model, $\hat{f}$, is a perfect fit. In other words, this is variability associated with $\epsilon$

---

class: middle, center

.question[
In the case of the `advertising` data, what types of factors are included in the irreducible error?
]

---

## Inference

$$\hat{\text{sales}} = \hat{f}(\text{tv},\text{radio}, \text{newspaper})$$

- **Question**: How is `sales` affected as `tv`, `radio`, and `newspaper` change?
--

- We can break this into several questions: 

--
    - What predictors are important for understanding sales? 
--
    - What is the relationship between sales and each predictor? 
--
    - Does the linear model adequately describe the relationship between `sales` and `tv`, `newspaper`, and `radio`, or is a more complex model required?

## Recap 

- We want to find the function that best fits the relationship between a response variable $Y$ and some predictor variables $X_1, \ldots, X_p$

- We will use **parametric** methods to find the function 
    - Choose the appropriate model
    - Estimate values of the model parameters

- There are two main purposes for the model: 
    - Prediction 
    - Inference
