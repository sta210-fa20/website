- DVS Intro to R Workshop - Jan 22 at 2p
     - [https://duke.libcal.com/event/4799048](https://duke.libcal.com/event/4799048)

---

## Agenda

- Motivate regression analysis 

- RStudio & R Markdown

---

## Packages and Data

```{r packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr) #read_csv() function
library(cowplot) #plot_grid() function
```

```{r data}
advertising <- read_csv("data/advertising.csv")
```

---

## Example: Sales vs. Advertising 

- Suppose you are a data scientist on the marketing team and the company wants to improve the sales of their premiere product 

- You want to understand the association between advertising budget and total sales 

- If there is an association between advertising and sales, then you can provide advice to the company about how to adjust the advertising budget to improve sales

---

## Advertising vs. Sales

```{r glimpse}
glimpse(advertising)
```

--

- <font class="vocab">Observations:</font> 200 markets

--

- <font class="vocab">Variables:</font> 
    - `tv`: Spending on TV ads (in $thousands)
    - `radio`: Spending on radio ads (in $thousands)
    - `newspaper`: Spending on newspaper ads (in $thousands)
    - `sales`: total sales (in $millions)
   
---

## Terminology

- `sales` is the <font class="vocab">response variable</font>
    - variable whose variation we want to understand / variable we wish to predict
    - also known as *outcome* or *dependent* variable

--

- `tv`, `radio`, `newspaper` are the <font class="vocab">predictor variables</font>
    - variables used to account for variation in the outcome
    - also known as *explanatory*, *independent*, or *input* variables

---

## Advertising vs. Sales

```{r plot-data, eval=F}
p1 <- advertising %>% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=tv,y=sales)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="blue",se=FALSE) 

p2 <- advertising %>% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=radio,y=sales)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="red", se=FALSE) 

p3 <- advertising %>% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=newspaper,y=sales)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="purple", se=FALSE) 

plot_grid(p1,p2,p3,ncol=3)
```

---

## Plot Data

```{r show-plot-1,echo=F}
p1 <- advertising %>% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=tv,y=sales)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="blue",se=FALSE) 

p2 <- advertising %>% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=radio,y=sales)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="red", se=FALSE) 

p3 <- advertising %>% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=newspaper,y=sales)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="purple", se=FALSE) 

plot_grid(p1,p2,p3,ncol=3)
```

--

Each line represents model we could use to predict `sales` using `tv`, `radio`, or `newspaper`

---

## Plot Data

```{r show-plot-2,echo=F}
p1 <- advertising %>% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=tv,y=sales)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="blue",se=FALSE) 

p2 <- advertising %>% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=radio,y=sales)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="red", se=FALSE) 

p3 <- advertising %>% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=newspaper,y=sales)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) +

$$\text{sales} = f(\text{tv}, \text{radio}, \text{newspaper}) + \epsilon$$
]

## Model 

.alert[
$$\text{sales} = f(\text{tv}, \text{radio}, \text{newspaper}) + \epsilon$$
]

- **Goal**: Estimate $f$

--

- How do we estimate $f$?

--

    - <font class="vocab">Non-parametric methods:</font> estimate $f$ by getting as close to the data points as possible without making explicit assumptions about the functional form of $f$
    
--

    - <font class="vocab">Parametric methods:</font> estimate $f$ by making an assumption about the functional form of $f$ then using the data to fit a model based on that form 
    
---

class: middle, center

.alert[
In this class, we will focus on <font class="vocab">parametric methods</font>
]

<small>
*Non-parametric methods covered in STA 325: Machine Learning & Data Mining*
</small>

---

## General form of model

.alert[
$$Y = f(\mathbf{X}) + \epsilon$$
]

- $Y$: quantitative response variable

- $\mathbf{X} = (X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p)$: predictor variables

- $f$: fixed but unknown function
    - systematic information $\mathbf{X}$ provides about $Y$

- $\epsilon$: random error term with mean 0 that is independent of $\mathbf{X}$ 
   
---

## How to estimate $f$?

In general, we will use the following steps to estimate $f$

1. Choose the functional form of $f$, i.e. <font class="vocab">choose the appropriate model given the data</font>
    - Ex: $f$ is a linear model
    $$f(\mathbf{X}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \dots + \beta_p X_p + \epsilon$$

--

2. Use the data to fit (or train) the model, i.e. <font class="vocab">estimate the model parameters</font>
    - Ex: Use a method to estimate the model parameters $\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p$

---

## Why estimate $f$?

Suppose we have the model

$$\text{sales} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{tv} + \beta_2 \times \text{radio} + \beta_3 \times \text{newspaper} + \epsilon$$
<br><br><br>

--

.question[
What are 1-2 questions you could answer using this model?
]

---

## Why estimate $f$?

There are two types of questions we may be interesting in answering with our model: 

- <font class="vocab">Prediction: </font> What is the expected $Y$  given particular values of  $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p$? 
--

    - Ex: What is the expected `sales` in a market if the company spends $100,000 TV ads, $30,000 on radio ads, and $10,000 on newspaper ads?

--

- <font class="vocab">Inference: </font> What is the relationship between $\mathbf{X}$ and $Y$. How does $Y$ change as a function of $\mathbf{X}$?
--

    - Ex: Which type of media advertising generates the largest boost in sales?


---

## Prediction 

$$\hat{\text{sales}} = \hat{f}(\text{tv},\text{radio}, \text{newspaper})$$

- **Question**: How accurate is $\hat{\text{sales}}$ as a prediction of $\text{sales}$?

- This depends on two quantities: reducible and irreducible error

--
    - <font class="vocab">Reducible error:</font> error that can potentially be reduced by using a model , $\hat{f}$, that is a more appropriate fit for the data

--
    - <font class="vocab">Irreducible error: </font> Error that cannot be reduced even if the model, $\hat{f}$, is a perfect fit. In other words, this is variability associated with $\epsilon$

---

class: middle, center

.question[
In the case of the `advertising` data, what types of factors are included in the irreducible error?
]

---

## Inference

$$\hat{\text{sales}} = \hat{f}(\text{tv},\text{radio}, \text{newspaper})$$

- **Question**: How is `sales` affected as `tv`, `radio`, and `newspaper` change?
--

- We can break this into several questions: 

--
    - What predictors are important for understanding sales? 
--
    - What is the relationship between sales and each predictor? 
--
    - Does the linear model adequately describe the relationship between `sales` and `tv`, `newspaper`, and `radio`, or is a more complex model required?

- We will use **parametric** methods to find the function 
    - Choose the appropriate model
    - Estimate values of the model parameters

- There are two main purposes for the model: 
    - Prediction 
    - Inference

## Reproducible data analysis

---

## Reproducibility checklist

.question[
What does it mean for a data analysis to be "reproducible"?
]

--

**Near-term goals:**

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear **why** it was done? 
(e.g., how were parameter settings chosen?)

--

**Long-term goals:**

- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?
---

# R and RStudio

---

## What is R/RStudio?

- R is a statistical programming language
- RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integrated development environment, IDE)
- At its simplest:<sup>*</sup>
    - R is like a car’s engine
    - RStudio is like a car’s dashboard

```{r fig.align="center",out.width="70%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/engine-dashboard.png")
```

## R/RStudio Tour

.center[
[DEMO]
]

Concepts introduced:

- Console
- Using R as a calculator
- Environment
- Loading and viewing a data frame
- Accessing a variable in a data frame
- R functions

---

### R essentials (a short list)

- **Functions** are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

```{r eval=FALSE}
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

--

- **Columns** (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
dataframe$var_name
```

--

- **Packages** are installed with the `install.packages` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```

# R Markdown

---


## R Markdown

- Fully reproducible reports -- the analysis is run from the beginning each time you knit

- Simple Markdown syntax for text

- Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks, narrative goes outside of chunks

---

## R Markdown Tour

.center[
[DEMO]
]

--

Concepts introduced:

- Copying a project in RStudio Cloud
- Knitting documents
- R Markdown and (some) R syntax

---

## R Markdown tips

**Resources**
- [R Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)
- Markdown Quick Reference: 
    - `Help -> Markdown Quick Reference`
<br><br>
--


**Remember**: The workspace of the R Markdown document is <u>separate</u> from the console

---

## Workspace vs. console

- Run the following in the console

```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- 2
x * 3
```

--

- Then, add the following chunk in your R Markdown document and knit

```{r eval = FALSE}
x * 3
```

--

.question[
What happens? Why the error?
]

---

## How will we use R Markdown?

- Every assignment / lab / project / etc. is an R Markdown document

- You'll always have a template R Markdown document to start with

- The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester

---
