## Sample Statistics and Sampling Distributions

---

---

## Terminology

.vocab[Population]: a group of individuals or objects we are interested in studying

.vocab[Parameter]: a numerical quantity derived from the population
(almost always unknown)

If we had data from every unit in the population, we could just calculate 
population parameters and be done!

--

**Unfortunately, we usually cannot do this.**

.vocab[Sample]: a subset of our population of interest

.vocab[Statistic]: a numerical quantity derived from a sample

---

## Inference

If the sample is .vocab[representative], then we can use the tools of probability and statistical inference to make .vocab[generalizable] conclusions to the broader population of interest.


&lt;img src="img/03/soup.png" width="406" height="234" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Similar to tasting a spoonful of soup while cooking to make an inference about the entire pot.

---

## Statistical inference

.vocab[Statistical inference] is the process of using sample data to make 
  conclusions about the underlying population the sample came from.

- .vocab[Estimation]: using the sample to estimate a plausible range of values for the unknown parameter

- .vocab[Testing]: evaluating whether our observed sample provides evidence 
for or against some claim about the population

Today we will focus on **estimation**.

---

## Variability of sample statistics

- We've seen that each sample from the population yields a slightly different 
sample statistic (sample mean, sample proportion, etc.)

- Previously we've quantified this value via simulation

- Today we talk about some of the theory underlying .vocab[sampling distributions],
particularly as they relate to sample means.

---

## Statistical inference

- Statistical inference is the act of generalizing from a sample in order to 
make conclusions regarding a population. 

- We are interested in population parameters, which we do not observe. Instead, 
we must calculate statistics from our sample in order to learn about them.

- As part of this process, we must quantify the degree of uncertainty in our 
sample statistic. 

---

## Sampling distribution of the mean

Suppose we’re interested in the mean resting heart rate of students at Duke, and 
are able to do the following:

--

1. Take a random sample of size `\(n\)` from this population, and calculate the 
mean resting heart rate in this sample, `\(\bar{X}_1\)`

--

2. Put the sample back, take a second random sample of size `\(n\)`, and calculate 
the mean resting heart rate from this new sample, `\(\bar{X}_2\)`

--

3. Put the sample back, take a third random sample of size `\(n\)`, and calculate
the mean resting heart rate from this sample, too...

--

...and so on.

---

## Sampling distribution of the mean

After repeating this many times, we have a dataset that has the
sample averages from the population: `\(\bar{X}_1\)`, `\(\bar{X}_2\)`, `\(\cdots\)`,
`\(\bar{X}_K\)` (assuming we took `\(K\)` total samples).

--

.question[
Can we say anything about the distribution of these sample means (that is, the
.vocab[sampling distribution] of the mean?) 
]

*(Keep in mind, we don't know what the underlying distribution of mean resting 
heart rate looks like in Duke students!)*

## The Central Limit Theorem

---

class: middle

A quick caveat...

For now, let's assume we know the underlying standard deviation, `\(\sigma\)`, from our distribution 

---

## The Central Limit Theorem

For a population with a well-defined mean `\(\mu\)` and standard deviation `\(\sigma\)`,
these three properties hold for the distribution of sample average `\(\bar{X}\)`,
assuming certain conditions hold:

--

1. The mean of the sampling distribution of the mean is identical to the 
population mean `\(\mu\)`.

--

2. The standard deviation of the distribution of the sample averages is
`\(\sigma/\sqrt{n}\)`.
  - This is called the .vocab[standard error] (SE) of the mean. 
 
--

3. For `\(n\)` large enough, the shape of the
sampling distribution of means is approximately .vocab[normally distributed].

---

## The normal (Gaussian) distribution

The normal distribution is unimodal and symmetric and is described by its
.vocab[density function]:

If a random variable `\(X\)` follows the normal distribution, then
`$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp\left\{ -\frac{1}{2}\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{\sigma^2} \right\}$$`
where `\(\mu\)` is the mean and `\(\sigma^2\)` is the variance `\((\sigma \text{ is the standard deviation})\)`

.alert[
We often write `\(N(\mu, \sigma)\)` to describe this distribution.
]
---

## The normal distribution (graphically)

&lt;img src="03-inference-review_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Wait, *any* distribution?

The central limit theorem tells us that *&lt;b&gt;sample averages&lt;/b&gt;* are normally distributed, if we have enough data and certain assumptions hold. 

This is true *even if our original variables are not normally distributed*.

Click [here](http://onlinestatbook.com/stat_sim/sampling_dist/index.html) to see an interactive demonstration of this idea.

---

## Conditions for CLT 

We need to check two conditions for CLT to hold: independence, sample size/distribution. 

--

✅ .vocab[Independence:] The sampled observations must be independent. This is 
difficult to check, but the following are useful guidelines:

- the sample must be randomly taken
- if sampling without replacement, sample size must be less than 10% of the 
    population size

--

If samples are independent, then by definition one sample's value does not "influence" another sample's value.

---

## Conditions for CLT 

✅ .vocab[Sample size / distribution:] 

- if data are numerical, usually n &gt; 30 is considered a large enough sample for the CLT to kick in
- if we know for sure that the underlying data are normally distributed, then the distribution of sample averages will also be exactly normal, regardless of the sample size
- if data are categorical, at least 10 successes and 10 failures.

.question[
How do the shapes, centers, and spreads of these distributions compare?
]

&lt;img src="03-inference-review_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Recap

- If certain assumptions are satisfied, regardless of the shape of the 
population distribution, the sampling distribution of the mean follows an 
approximately normal distribution.

--

- The center of the sampling distribution is at the center of the population 
distribution.

--

- The sampling distribution is less variable than the population distribution 
(and we can quantify by how much).

--

.question[
What is the standard error, and how are the standard error and sample size 
related? What does that say about how the spread of the sampling distribution
changes as `\(n\)` increases?

## Looking ahead...

We will use the Central Limit Theorem and the normal distribution to conduct statistical inference.

---
## The Central Limit Theorem

For a population with a well-defined mean `\(\mu\)` and standard deviation `\(\sigma\)`,
these three properties hold for the distribution of sample average `\(\bar{X}\)`,
assuming certain conditions hold:

✅ The distribution of the sample statistic is nearly normal

✅ The distribution is centered at the (often unknown) population parameter

✅ The variability of the distribution is inversely proportional to the square 
root of the sample size

---

## Why do we care?

Knowing the distribution of the sample statistic `\(\bar{X}\)` can help us

--

- estimate a population parameter as point **estimate** `\(\boldsymbol{\pm}\)` **margin of error**
  - the .vocab[margin of error] is comprised of a measure of how confident we want to be and how variable the sample statistic is
--

&lt;br&gt; 

- test for a population parameter by evaluating how likely it is to obtain to observed sample statistic when assuming that the null hypothesis is true
  - this probability will depend on how variable the sampling distribution is

---

## Inference based on the CLT

---

## Inference based on the CLT

If necessary conditions are met, we can also use inference methods based on the CLT. Suppose we know the true population standard deviation. 

--

Then the CLT tells us that `\(\bar{X}\)` approximately has the distribution `\(N\left(\mu, \sigma/\sqrt{n}\right)\)`. 

That is,

`$$Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \sim N(0, 1)$$`

## What if `\(\sigma\)` isn't known?

&lt;img src="img/03/guinness.jpg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## T distribution

- In practice, we never know the true value of `\(\sigma\)`, and so we estimate it from our data with `\(s\)`.

We can make the following test statistic for testing
a single sample's population mean, which has a .vocab[t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom]:

.question[
$$ T = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1}$$
]

---

## T distribution 


The t-distribution is also unimodal and symmetric, and is centered at 0

--

Thicker tails than the normal distribution
  - This is to make up for additional variability introduced by using `\(s\)` instead of `\(\sigma\)` in calculation of the 
SE

## Resident satisfaction in Durham

`durham_survey` contains resident responses to a survey given by the City of
Durham in 2018. These are a randomly selected, representative sample of
Durham residents.

Questions were rated 1 - 5, with 1 being "highly dissatisfied" and 5 being
"highly satisfied."

--

.question[
Is there evidence that, on average, Durham residents are generally satisfied (score greater than 3) with the quality of the public library system? 
]

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis


```r
durham &lt;- read_csv("data/durham_survey.csv") %&gt;%
  filter(quality_library != 9)
```

            med = median(quality_library), 
            sd = sd(quality_library), n = n())
```

---

## Hypotheses

.question[
What are the hypotheses for evaluating if Durham residents, on average, are generally satisfied with the public library system?
]

--

`$$H_0: \mu = 3$$` 
`$$H_a: \mu &gt; 3$$`

---

## Conditions

.question[
What conditions must be satisfied to conduct this hypothesis test using methods 
based on the CLT? Are these conditions satisfied?
]

--

**Independence?** 

--

✅ The residents were randomly selected for the survey, and 521 is less than 10% of the Durham population (~ 270,000).

--

**Sample size / distribution?**

--

✅ 521 &gt; 30, so the sample is large enough to apply the Central Limit Theorem. 

---

## Calculating the test statistic

Summary statistics from the sample:


```
## # A tibble: 1 x 3
##    xbar     s     n
##   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;
## 1  3.97 0.900   521
```

--

And the CLT says:

`$$\bar{x} \sim N\left(mean = \mu, SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$$`

--

.question[
How many standard errors away from the population mean is the observed sample 
mean?
]

.question[
How likely are we to observe a sample mean that is at least as extreme as the 
observed sample mean, if in fact the null hypothesis is true?
]

---

## Calculations

--


```r
(se &lt;- durham_summary$s / sqrt(durham_summary$n)) # SE
```

```
## [1] 0.03944416
```

--


```r
(t &lt;- (durham_summary$xbar - 3) / se) # Test statistic
```

```
## [1] 24.57372
```

--


```r
(df &lt;- durham_summary$n - 1) # Degrees of freedom
```

```
## [1] 520
```

--


```r
pt(t, df, lower.tail = FALSE) # P-value, P(T &gt; t |H_0 true)
```

```
## [1] 2.247911e-89
```

---

## Conclusion

The p-value is very small, so we reject `\(H_0\)`.

--

The data provide sufficient evidence at the `\(\alpha = 0.05\)` level that Durham residents, on average, are satisfied with the quality of the public library system.

## Other built-in functionality in R

- There are more built in functions for doing some of these tests in R.

- However a learning goal is this course is not to go through an exhaustive list of all CLT based tests and how to implement them

- Instead the goal is to understand how these methods are / are not like the simulation based methods we learned about earlier

--

.question[
What is similar, and what is different, between CLT based test of means vs. simulation based test?
