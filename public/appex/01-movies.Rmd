We will look at the relationship between budget and revenue for movies made in the United States in 1986 to 2016. The data is from the [Internet Movie Database (IMDB)](https://www.imdb.com/).

```{r load-packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
```

## Data

The `movies` data set includes basic information about each movie including budget, genre, movie studio, director, etc. A full list of the variables may be found [here](https://github.com/danielgrijalva/movie-stats).

```{r read-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
movies <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielgrijalva/movie-stats/master/movies.csv")
```

```{r filter-data}
movies <- movies %>%
  filter(country=="USA", 
         !(genre %in% c("Musical","War","Western"))) #remove genres with < 10 movies
```

```{r view-data}
movies
```

## Analysis

### Part 1 

We begin by looking at how the average gross revenue (`gross`) has changed over time. Since we want to visualize the results, we will choose a few genres of interest for the analysis. 

```{r genre-list}
genre_list <- c("Comedy", "Action", "Animation", "Horror")
```

```{r plot-rating, fig.width=10, warning=FALSE}
movies %>%
  filter(genre %in% genre_list) %>% 
  group_by(genre,year) %>%
  summarise(avg_gross = mean(gross)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = avg_gross, color=genre)) +
    geom_point() + 
    geom_line() +
    ylab("Average Gross Revenue (in US Dollars)") +
    ggtitle("Gross Revenue Over Time")
```

1. Suppose we fit a regression equation for each genre that uses `year` to predict `gross revenue`. Which genre do you expect to have the largest slope? (*Submit your response in the online form.*)

### Part 2

Next, let's see the relationship between a movie's budget and its gross revenue.

```{r plot-revenue, fig.width=10, warning=FALSE}
movies %>%
  filter(genre %in% genre_list, budget > 0) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=log(budget), y = log(gross), color=genre)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm",se=FALSE) + 
  xlab("Log-transformed Budget")+
  ylab("Log-transformed Gross Revenue") +
  facet_wrap(~ genre)
```

1. Suppose we fit a regression equation for each genre that uses `budget` to predict gross revenue (`gross`). What are the signs of the correlation between `budget` and `gross` and the slope in each regression equation?

2. Which genre has the smallest residuals, on average? Note: *residual = observed revenue - predicted revenue*. 

3. In the remaining time, discuss the following: Notice in the graph above that `budget` and `gross` are log-transformed. Why are the log-transformed values of the variables displayed rather than the original values (in U.S. dollars)?
