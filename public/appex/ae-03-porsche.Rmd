## Clone a repo + start a new project

- Click on the link provided in the slides to create your own private repo for this exercise.

- Go to the `ae-03-[GITHUB USERNAME]` repo on GitHub that you created

- Click on the green **Code** button, **Use HTTPS**, and click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

- Go to https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu/containers and login with your Duke NetID and Password. Click to log into the Docker container **RStudio -  statistics application with Rmarkdown and knitr support**. You should now see the RStudio environment. 

- Go to *File* `r emo::ji("arrow_right")` *New Project* `r emo::ji("arrow_right")` *Version Control* `r emo::ji("arrow_right")` *Git*. 

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box *Repository URL*. You can leave *Project Directory Name* empty. It will default to the name of the GitHub repo.

- Click *Create Project*, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed the *Files* pane in RStudio. 

### Configure git

Before we start the exercise, we need to configure your git so that RStudio can communicate with GitHub. This requires two pieces of information: your email address and your name.

Type the following lines of code in the **Console** in RStudio filling in your GitHub username and email address associated with your GitHub account.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name= "github username", user.email="your email")
```

**RStudio and GitHub can now communicate with each other and you are ready to do the exercise!**

## Price vs. Mileage



```{r load-data, message=FALSE}
porsche <- read_csv("data/PorschePrice.csv")
```


In this AE, we will analyze the relationship between mileage and price for `r nrow(porsche)` Porsches for sale. More specifically, we want to use the mileage to understand variation in the price. The data set includes the following variables: 

- `Price`: Asking price for the car (in $1,000’s)
- `Age`: Age of the car (in years)
- `Mileage`: Previous miles driven (in 1,000’s)

Let's start by getting a quick view of the data. 

```{r glimpse}
glimpse(porsche)
```

### Exploratory data analysis 

1. Which variable is the response? Which is the predictor? 

Let's look at the distribution of each variable. 

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(data = porsche, aes(x = Mileage)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  labs(title = "Mileage of Porsches", 
       x = "Mileage (in 1000's)")

p2 <- ggplot(data = porsche, aes(x = Price)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  labs(title = "Price of Porsches", 
       x = "Price (in $1,000s)")

p1 + p2 #using the patchwork package
```

```{r}
porsche %>%
  summarise(mean_mileage = mean(Mileage), 
            sd_mileage = sd(Mileage), 
            median_mileage = median(Mileage), 
            IQR_mileage = IQR(Mileage))
```



```{r}
porsche %>%
  summarise(mean_price = mean(Price), 
            sd_price = sd(Price), 
            median_price = median(Price), 
            IQR_price = IQR(Price))
```
1. Describe the distribution of `Mileage`. Include the shape, center, spread, and any outliers. 
2. Describe the distribution of `Price`. Include the shape, center, spread, and any outliers. 

Before fitting a linear model, let's look at the relationship between `Mileage` and `Porsche`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = porsche, aes(x = Mileage, y = Price)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Mileage (in 1,000s)", 
       y = "Price (in $1,000s)", 
       title = "Price vs. Mileage for Porsches")
```

1. What sign do you expect the slope to have? 

2. Around what value do you expect the intercept to take? 

### Fitting a simple linear regression model 

We will use the `lm` function to fit the linear model. The syntax for `lm` function is `lm(Y ~ X, data = dataset`). 

Then, we will use the `tidy` function from the **broom** package to print the results in a "tidy" format, i.e. each row contains the statistics for a model coefficient. 

Fill in the `lm` function to fit a regression model and assign it to `price_model`. Remove `eval = FALSE`, so the code chunk runs when you knit. 

Knit the file to see the model output. 


```{r model, eval = FALSE}
price_model <- lm(___________)
tidy(price_model)
```

Commit the updated files with a short informative commit message, and push the updates to GitHub. 

1. Write the model equation. 

2. Interpret the slope in the context of the data.

3. The intercept is the mean price for what group of Porsches?

### Residuals 


We can use the `augment` function to get the predicted values (`.fitted`), residuals (`.resid`) and other statistics we'll use later to assess the model fit. 

Fill in the model name in the augment function. Then, remove `eval = FALSE`, so the code chunk runs when you knit. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
price_aug <- augment(price_model)
```

Consider the first observation. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
price_aug %>%
  slice(1)
```

1. What is the residual? How was it calculated? 

2. Did the model over or under predict the price of this Porsche? 

Knit your Rmd file to view the updated output. Commit your changes with an informative commit message, and push the updated files to GitHub.
