### What is regression analysis?

"In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when <font class="vocab">**the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors')**</font>. More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed."

### Regression in the "real" world

### Is it the same as machine learning?

"Many methods from statistics and machine learning (ML) may, in principle, be used for both prediction and inference. However, .vocab[statistical methods have a long-standing focus on inference]...By contrast, ML concentrates on prediction..."

### Movie Data Analysis

Notice in the graph in Part 2 that `budget` and `gross` are log-transformed. Why are the log-transformed values of the variables displayed rather than the original values (in U.S. dollars)?

### Where to find help

- .vocab[Ask during lecture!] There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone. 

--

- .vocab[Office Hours]: A lot of questions are most effectively answered in-person, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!

--

- .vocab[Piazza]: Outside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on Piazza since there are likely other students with the same questions. 
    - If you know the answer to a question posted on Piazza, I encourage you to respond!

### Diversity & Inclusion 

I strive to create a  learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:

- If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.

- I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.

### Reproducibility checklist

.question[
What does it mean for a data analysis to be "reproducible"?
]

--

**Near-term goals:**

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear **why** it was done? 
(e.g., how were parameter settings chosen?)

**Long-term goals:**

- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?

Tips for creating a username from [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice).

- Incorporate your actual name!
- Reuse your username from other contexts if you can, e.g., Twitter or Slack.
- Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.
- Shorter is better than longer.
- Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible.
- Make it timeless. Don’t highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence.
- Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming, like `NA`.
