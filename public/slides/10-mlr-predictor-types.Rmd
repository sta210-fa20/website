## Peer-to-peer lender

Today's data is a sample of 50 loans made through a  peer-to-peer lending club. The data is in the `loan50` data frame in the openintro R package.


```{r echo = F}
ggplot(data = loan50, aes(x = interest_rate)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  labs(x = "Interest rate", 
       title = "Distribution of interest rate")
```

---

## Variables

**Predictors**
- .vocab[`verified_income`]: Whether borrower's income source and amount have been verified (`Not Verified`, `Source Verified`, `Verified`)
- .vocab[`debt_to_income`]: Debt-to-income ratio, i.e. the percentage of a borrower's total debt divided by their total income
- .vocab[`annual_income`]: Annual income (in $1000s)

**Response**
- .vocab[`interest_rate`]: Interest rate for the loan

```{r}
loan50 <- loan50 %>%
  mutate(annual_income = annual_income / 1000)
```

---

## Predictor variables 

```{r echo = F, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 9}
library(patchwork)

p1 <- ggplot(data = loan50, aes(x = verified_income)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Verified Income", 
       x = "", y = "") +
  coord_flip()

p2 <- ggplot(data = loan50, aes(x = debt_to_income)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  labs(title = "Debt to income ratio",
       x = "", y = "")

p3 <- ggplot(data = loan50, aes(x = annual_income)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  labs(title = "Annual income (in $1000s)",
       x = "", y = "")

p1 + p2 / p3
```

---

## Response vs. Predictors

```{r echo = F, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 9}
p4 <- ggplot(data = loan50, aes(x = verified_income, y = interest_rate)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "steelblue") + 
  labs(y = "Interest Rate", 
       x = "Income verification")

p5 <- ggplot(data = loan50, aes(x = debt_to_income, y = interest_rate)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue") + 
  labs(y = "", 
       x = "Debt to income ratio")


p6 <- ggplot(data = loan50, aes(x = annual_income, y = interest_rate)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue") + 
  labs(y = "", 
       x = "Annual income (in $1000s)")

p4 + p5 / p6
```

---

## Regression Model 

```{r echo = F}
int_model <- lm(interest_rate ~ debt_to_income + verified_income  + annual_income, data = loan50)
tidy(int_model, conf.int = T) %>% kable(format = "markdown", digits = 3)
```

## Mean-centered variables

## Mean-Centered Variables

If we are interested in interpreting the intercept, we can .vocab[mean-center] the quantitative predictors in the model.

We can mean-center a quantitative predictor $X_j$ using the following: 

$$X_{j_{Cent}} = X_{j}- \bar{X}_{j}$$

--

If we mean-center all quantitative variables, then the intercept is interpreted as the expected value of the response variable when all quantitative variables are at their mean value.

---

## Loans data: mean-center variables

```{r}
loan50 <- loan50 %>%
  mutate(debt_inc_cent = debt_to_income - mean(debt_to_income), 
         annual_income_cent = annual_income - mean(annual_income))
```

```{r fig.height = 4, fig.width = 9}
p1 <- ggplot(data = loan50, aes(x = debt_to_income)) +
  geom_density(fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "", 
       title = "Debt to income ratio")

p2 <- ggplot(data = loan50, aes(x = debt_inc_cent)) +
  geom_density(fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "", 
       title = "Mean-centered Debt to income ratio")

p3 <- ggplot(data = loan50, aes(x = annual_income)) +
  geom_density(fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "", 
       title = "Annual income (in $1000s)")

p4 <- ggplot(data = loan50, aes(x = annual_income_cent)) +
  geom_density(fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "", 
       title = "Mean-centered Annual income (in $1000s)")

(p1 + p3) / (p2 + p4)
```

## Using mean-centere variables in the model 

.question[
How do you expect the model to change if we use the `debt_inc_cent` and `annual_income_cent` in the model? 
]

--

```{r echo = F}
cent_model <- lm(interest_rate ~ debt_inc_cent + verified_income + annual_income_cent, data = loan50)
tidy(cent_model, conf.int = T) %>% 
  kable(format = "markdown" , digits = 3)
```

## Original vs. mean-centered model 

.pull-left[
.small[
```{r}
tidy(int_model) %>%
  select(term, estimate) %>%
kable(format = "markdown", digits = 3)

]

```{r}
tidy(cent_model) %>%
  select(term, estimate) %>%
kable(format = "markdown", digits = 3)
```
]

## Indicator variables 

---

## Indicator variables

- Suppose there is a categorical variable with $K$ categories (levels)

- We can make $K$ indicator variables - one indicator for each category

- An .vocab[indicator variable] takes values 1 or 0 
  - 1 if the observation belongs to that category
  - 0 if the observation does not belong to that category

---

## Indicator variable for `verified_income`

.small[
```{r echo = T}
loan50 <- loan50 %>%
  mutate(not_verified = 
           if_else(verified_income == "Not Verified", 1, 0),
         source_verified = 
           if_else(verified_income == "Source Verified", 1, 0),
         verified = 
           if_else(verified_income == "Verified", 1, 0)
  )
```
]

--

.small[
```{r}
loan50 %>%
  select(verified_income, not_verified, source_verified, verified) %>%
  slice(1, 3, 6)
```
]

---

## Indicators in the model

We will use $K-1$ of the indicator variables in the model
    
The .vocab[baseline] is the category that doesn't have a term in the model. 

The coefficients of the indicator variables in the model are interpreted as  the expected change in the response compared to the baseline, holding all other variables constant.

---
## Interpreting `verified_income`

.small[
```{r echo = F}
tidy(cent_model, conf.int  = T) %>%
  kable(format = "html", digits = 3) %>%
  row_spec(c(3,4), background = "#dce5b2")
```
]

--

.vocab[The baseline category is "Not verified".]

---

## Interpreting `verified_income`

A person with source verified income is expected to take a loan with an interest rate that is 2.211% higher than the rate on loans to those whose income is not verified, holding all else constant. 

--

<br> 

A person with verified income is expected to take a loan with an interest rate that is 6.880% higher than the rate on loans to those whose income is not verified, holding all else constant.

## Interaction terms

---

## Interaction Terms

Sometimes the relationship between a predictor variable and the response depends on the value of another predictor variable

This is an .vocab[interaction effect]
  
To account for this, we can include .vocab[interaction terms] in the model.

---

## Interest rate vs. annual income

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 9}
p1 <- ggplot(data = loan50, aes(x = annual_income, y = interest_rate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
  labs(x = "Annual income (in $1000s)", 
       y = "Interest rate")
```

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 9}
p2 <- ggplot(data = loan50, aes(x = annual_income, y = interest_rate, 
          color = verified_income)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
    labs(x = "Annual income (in $1000s)", 
       y = "", color = "")  + theme(legend.position="top")
```

```{r fig.height = 3}
patchwork <- p1 + p2
patchwork + plot_annotation(title = 'Interest rate vs. annual income')
```

--

The lines are .vocab[not parallel] indicating there is an .vocab[interaction effect]. The slope of annual income differs based on the income verification. 

---

## Interaction term in model

```{r}
model_w_int <- lm(interest_rate ~ debt_inc_cent  +  debt_inc_cent + annual_income_cent + verified_income * annual_income_cent, data = loan50)
```

```{r echo = F}
tidy(model_w_int) %>%
  kable(format = "html", digits = 3) %>%
  row_spec(c(6,7), background = "#dce5b2")
```

---

## Interpreting interaction terms

.vocab[What the interaction means: ]

The effect of annual income on the interest rate differs by -0.016 when the income is source verified compared to when it is not verified, holding all else constant. 

--

<br>

.vocab[Interpreting `annual_income` for source verified:]

If the income is source verified, we expect the interest rate to decrease by 0.023% (-0.007 + -0.016) for each additional thousand dollars in annual income, holding all else constant.
