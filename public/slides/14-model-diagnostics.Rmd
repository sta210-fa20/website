## Influential Point

An observation is .vocab[influential] if removing it substantially changes the coefficients of the regression model 

```{r,echo=F}
library(cowplot)
set.seed(12)
n <- 20
x <- c(runif(n,0,1))
y <- 3*x + rnorm(n,0,.5)
new.pt <- data.frame(x=2,y=0)
x.new <- c(x,2)
y.new <- c(y,0)
data <- bind_cols(x=x.new,y=y.new)
p1<- ggplot(data=data,aes(x=x,y=y))+geom_point(alpha =0.5)  + 
              geom_point(data=new.pt,color="red",size=4,shape=17) + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm",se=F) + 
  labs(title = "With Influential Point")+ theme_light()+
  theme(title=element_text(hjust=0.5,size=14)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,2)) 

data2 <- bind_cols(x=x,y=y)
p2 <- ggplot(data=data2,aes(x=x,y=y))+geom_point(alpha=0.5) + geom_smooth(method="lm",se=F) + 
  labs(title="Without Influential Point") + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 2)) + theme_light() + theme(title=element_text(hjust=0.5,size=14))  
plot_grid(p1,p2,ncol=2)
```

## Influential points

- Influential points have a large impact on the coefficients and standard errors used for inference

--

- These points can sometimes be identified in a scatterplot if there is only one predictor variable
  + This is often not the case when there are multiple predictors

--

- We will use measures to quantify an individual observation's influence on the regression model 
  + **leverage**, **standardized residuals**, and **Cook's distance**
  
---

## Model diagnostics in R

Use the <font class="vocab">`augment`</font> function in the broom package to output the model diagnostics (along with the predicted values and residuals)

- response and predictor variables in the model
- `.fitted`: predicted values
- `.se.fit`: standard errors of predicted values
- `.resid`: residuals
- `.hat`: leverage
- `.sigma`: estimate of residual standard deviation when the corresponding observation is dropped from model
- `.cooksd`: Cook's distance
- `.std.resid`: standardized residuals]

---

## Example: SAT Averages by State

- This data set contains the average SAT score (out of 1600) and other variables that may be associated with SAT performance for each of the 50 U.S. states. The data is based on test takers for the 1982 exam.

- Response variable:
  + <font class="vocab">`SAT`</font>: average total SAT score

.footnote[Data comes from `case1201` data set in the `Sleuth3` package]

---

## SAT Averages: Predictors

- <font class="vocab">`Takers`</font>: percentage of high school seniors who took exam
- <font class="vocab">`Income`</font>: median income of families of test-takers ($ hundreds)
- <font class="vocab">`Years`</font>: average number of years test-takers had formal education in social sciences, natural sciences, and humanities
- <font class="vocab">`Public`</font>: percentage of test-takers who attended public high schools
- <font class="vocab">`Expend`</font>: total state expenditure on high schools ($ hundreds per student)
- <font class="vocab">`Rank`</font>: median percentile rank of test-takers within their high school classes

---

## Model

```{r}
sat_scores <- Sleuth3::case1201 %>%
  select(-State) 
```

```{r}
sat_model <- lm(SAT ~ ., data = sat_scores)
tidy(sat_model) %>%
  kable(format = "markdown", digits = 3)
```

---

## SAT: Augmented Data

```{r echo = F}
sat_aug <- augment(sat_model) %>%
  mutate(obs_num = row_number()) #add observation number for plots
```

.midi[
```{r}
glimpse(sat_aug)
```

## Leverage 

---

## Leverage

- .vocab[Leverage:] measure of the distance between an observation's values of the predictor variables and the average values of the predictor variables for the entire data set

--
  
- An observation has **high leverage** if its combination of values for the predictor variables is very far from the typical combination of values in the data 

--

- Observations with high leverage should be considered as *potential* influential points

---

## Calculating leverage

.vocab[Simple Regression:] leverage of the $i^{th}$ observation 
.alert[
$$h_i =  \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}(x_j-\bar{x})^2}$$
]

--

.vocab[Multiple Regression:] leverage of the $i^{th}$ observation is the $i^{th}$ diagonal  of
$$\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{X}(\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T$$

--

- *Note*: Leverage only depends on values of the **<u>predictor</u>** variables

---

## High Leverage

The sum of the leverages for all points is $p + 1$
- In the case of SLR $\sum_{i=1}^n h_i = 2$

--

- The "typical" leverage is $\frac{(p+1)}{n}$

--

.question[
An observation has **high leverage** if 
$$h_i > \frac{2(p+1)}{n}$$
]

---

## High Leverage

If there is point with high leverage, ask 

`r emo::ji("question")` Is there a data entry error? 

`r emo::ji("question")` Is this observation within the scope of individuals for which you want to make predictions and draw conclusions? 

`r emo::ji("question")` Is this observation impacting the estimates of the model coefficients, especially for interactions?

--

Just because a point has high leverage does not necessarily mean it will have a substantial impact on the regression. Therefore we need to check other measures.

---

## SAT: Leverage

```{r}
leverage_threshold <- 2*(6+1)/nrow(sat_aug)
```

High leverage if $h_i > \frac{2 * (6 + 1)}{50} = 0.28$

```{r fig.height = 3, echo = F}
ggplot(data = sat_aug, aes(x = obs_num, y = .hat)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = leverage_threshold, color = "red")+
  labs(x = "Observation Number",y = "Leverage",title = "Leverage") +
  geom_text(aes(label=ifelse(.hat > leverage_threshold, as.character(obs_num), "")), nudge_x = 4)
```

---

## Observations with high leverage

```{r}
sat_aug %>% filter(.hat > leverage_threshold) %>% 
  select(obs_num, Takers, Income, Years, Public, Expend, Rank) %>%
  kable()
```

.question[
Why do you think these observations have high leverage?
]

---

## Let's dig into the data

```{r echo = F, fig.height = 3}
p1 <- sat_aug %>%
  mutate(public_outlier = if_else(obs_num == 22, "Y", "N")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Public)) +
  geom_dotplot(aes(fill = public_outlier)) + 
  labs(x = "Takers", title = "Louisiana (22) has a low Takers", 
       y = "") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

p2 <- sat_aug %>%
  mutate(expend_outlier = if_else(obs_num == 29, "Y", "N")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Expend)) +
  geom_dotplot(aes(fill = expend_outlier)) + 
  labs(x = "Expenditure", title = "Alaska (29) has a high Expend", 
       y= "") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

p1  + p2
```

## Standardized & Studentized Residuals

---

## Standardized & Studentized Residuals

- What is the best way to identify outliers (points that don't fit the pattern from the regression line)? 
  
--

- Look for points that have large residuals

--

- We want a common scale, so we can more easily identify "large" residuals

--

- We will look at each residual divided by its standard error

---

## Standardized & Studentized residuals

--

.alert[
$$std.res_i = \frac{y_i - \hat{y}_i}{\hat{\sigma}_\epsilon\sqrt{1-h_i}}$$

where $\hat{\sigma}_\epsilon$ is the regression standard error
]

--
.alert[
$$stud.res_i = \frac{y_i - \hat{y}_i}{\hat{\sigma}_{(i)}\sqrt{1-h_i}}$$
where $\hat{\sigma}_{(i)}$ is the regression standard error from fitting the model with the $i^{th}$ point removed
]

---

## Standardized & Studentized residuals

- Observations with high leverage tend to have low values of standardized residuals because they pull the regression line towards them 

--

- This issue is avoided using the studentized residuals, since the regression standard error is calculated without the possible influential point.

--

- Standardized residuals are produced by `augment` in the column `.std.resid`

--

- Studentized residuals can be calculated using `.sigma`, `.resid`, and `.hat` produced by `augment`

---

## Using standardized & studentized residuals

Observations that have standardized residuals of large magnitude are outliers, since they don't fit the pattern determined by the regression model 

.alert[
An observation is a **moderate outlier** if its standardized residual is beyond $\pm 2$.

An observation is a **serious outlier** if its standardized residual is beyond $\pm 3$.
]

--

.vocab[Make residual plots with standardized residuals to make it easier to identify outliers and check constant variance condition.]

---

## SAT: Standardized residuals vs. predicted

```{r fig.height = 3, echo = F}
ggplot(data = sat_aug, aes(x = .fitted,y = .std.resid)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0,color = "red") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = -2,color = "black",linetype = "dotted") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 2,color = "black",linetype = "dotted") +
    geom_hline(yintercept = -3,color = "red",linetype = "dotted") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 3,color = "red",linetype = "dotted") +
  labs(x ="Predicted",y ="Standardized Residuals",title = "Standardized Residuals vs. Predicted") +
  geom_text(aes(label = ifelse(abs(.std.resid) > 2,as.character(obs_num),"")), nudge_x = 4) +
  theme_bw()
```

## Cook's Distance

---

## Motivating Cook's Distance

An observation's influence on the regression line depends on 

- How close it lies to the general trend of the data - $std.resid_i$

- Its leverage - $h_i$

--

.vocab[Cook's Distance] is a statistic that includes both of these components to measure an observation's overall impact on the model 

---

## Cook's Distance

.alert[
**Cook's distance for the $i^{th}$ observation**

$$D_i = \frac{(std.res_i)^2}{p + 1}\bigg(\frac{h_i}{1-h_i}\bigg)$$
]

--

An observation with large $D_i$ is said to have a strong influence on the predicted values 

--

An observation with 
- $D_i > 0.5$ is **moderately influential**
- $D_i > 1$ is **very influential**

---

## Cook's Distance

```{r fig.height = 3}
ggplot(data = sat_aug, aes(x = obs_num, y = .cooksd)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, color = "red", lty = 2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1,color = "red") +
  labs(x= "Observation Number",y = "Cook's Distance",title = "Cook's Distance") +
  geom_text(aes(label = ifelse(.cooksd > 1,as.character(obs_num),"")), nudge_x = 2)
```

---

## Influential point: Alaska

```{r echo = F}
sat_aug %>% filter(.cooksd > 1) %>% 
  select(obs_num, Takers, Income, Years, Public, Expend, Rank)
```

--

- high leverage `r sat_aug$.hat[29]`
- large magnitude standardized residual `r sat_aug$.std.resid[29]`

---

## Model with and without Alaska

.pull-left[
**With Alaska**

```{r echo = F}
orig_data <- Sleuth3::case1201 %>%
  select(-State) 
  lm(SAT ~ ., data = orig_data) %>%
    tidy() %>% 
    select(term, estimate) %>%
    kable(format = "markdown", digits = 3)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
**Without Alaska**
```{r echo = F}
new_data <- Sleuth3::case1201 %>%
  filter(State != "Alaska") %>%
  select(-State)
  lm(SAT ~ ., data = new_data) %>%
    tidy() %>%
    select(term, estimate) %>%
    kable(format = "markdown", digits = 3)
```
]

---

## Using these measures

- Standardized residuals, leverage, and Cook's Distance should all be examined together 

- Examine plots of the measures to identify observations that are outliers, high leverage, and may potentially impact the model. 

---

## What to do with outliers/influential points?

It is **<font color="green">OK</font>** to drop an observation based on the **<u>predictor variables</u>** if...

- It is meaningful to drop the observation given the context of the problem 

- You intended to build a model on a smaller range of the predictor variables. Mention this in the write up of the results and be careful to avoid extrapolation when making predictions
    
---

## What to do with outliers/influential points?

It is **<font color="red">not OK</font>** to drop an observation based on the response variable

- These are legitimate observations and should be in the model

- You can try transformations or increasing the sample size by collecting more data

--

.question[
In either instance, you can try building the model with and without the outliers/influential observations
]

## Multicollinearity

---

## Why multicollinearity is a problem

- We can't include two variables that have a perfect linear association with each other

- If we did so, we could not find unique estimates for the model coefficients


---

## Example

Suppose the true population regression equation is $y = 3 + 4x$

--

- Suppose we try estimating that equation using a model with variables $x$ and $z = x/10$
--

$$\begin{aligned}\hat{y}&= \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1x  + \hat{\beta}_2z\\[8pt]
&= \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1x  + \hat{\beta}_2\frac{x}{10}\\[8pt]
&= \hat{\beta}_0 + \bigg(\hat{\beta}_1 + \frac{\hat{\beta}_2}{10}\bigg)x\end{aligned}$$

---

## Example

$$\hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \bigg(\hat{\beta}_1 + \frac{\hat{\beta}_2}{10}\bigg)x$$

--

- We can set $\hat{\beta}_1$ and $\hat{\beta}_2$ to any two numbers such that $\hat{\beta}_1 + \frac{\hat{\beta}_2}{10} = 4$

--

- Therefore, we are unable to choose the "best" combination of $\hat{\beta}_1$ and $\hat{\beta}_2$
  
---

## Why multicollinearity is a problem

- When we have almost perfect collinearities (i.e. highly correlated predictor variables), the standard errors for our regression coefficients inflate

- In other words, we lose precision in our estimates of the regression coefficients 

- This impedes our ability to use the model for inference or prediction
  
---
 
## Detecting Multicollinearity

Multicollinearity may occur when...
- There are very high correlations $(r > 0.9)$ among two or more predictor variables, especially when the sample size is small

--

- One (or more) predictor variables is an almost perfect linear combination of the others 

--

- Include a quadratic in the model mean-centering the variable first

--

- Including interactions between two or more continuous variables

---

 

## Detecting multicollinearity in the EDA

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` Look at a correlation matrix of the predictor variables, including all indicator variables 
- Look out for values close to 1 or -1
  
`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` Look at a scatterplot matrix of the predictor variables
- Look out for plots that show a relatively linear relationship

---

## Detecting Multicollinearity (VIF)

.vocab[Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)]: Measure of multicollinearity in the regression model

.alert[
$$VIF(\hat{\beta}_j) = \frac{1}{1-R^2_{X_j|X_{-j}}}$$
]

where $R^2_{X_j|X_{-j}}$ is the proportion of variation $X$ that is explained by the linear combination of the other explanatory variables in the model.

---

## Detecting Multicollinearity (VIF)

Typically $VIF > 10$ indicates concerning multicollinearity
- Variables with similar values of VIF are typically the ones correlated with each other

<br>

Use the .vocab[`vif()`] function in the **rms** R package to calculate VIF

---

## VIF For SAT Model

```{r echo = T}
vif(sat_model) %>% tidy() %>% kable()
```

--

.alert[
`Takers` and `Rank` are correlated. We need to remove one of these variables and refit the model.
]

---

## Model without `Takers`

.small[
```{r echo  = F}
m1 <- lm(SAT ~ Income + Years + Public + Expend + Rank, data = sat_scores) 
m1 %>%
  tidy() %>%
  kable(format = "markdown", digits = 3)
```
]

```{r echo = F}
glance(m1) %>%
  select(adj.r.squared, AIC, BIC)
```


---

## Model without `Rank`

.small[
```{r echo  = F}
m2 <- lm(SAT ~ Income + Years + Public + Expend + Takers, data = sat_scores) 
m2 %>%
  tidy() %>%
  kable(format = "markdown", digits = 3)
```
]

```{r echo = F}
glance(m2) %>%
  select(adj.r.squared, AIC, BIC)
```
